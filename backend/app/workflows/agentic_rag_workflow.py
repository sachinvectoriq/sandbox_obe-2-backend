Agentic RAG Workflow using Microsoft Agent Framework.

This workflow implements an iterative retrieval-augmented generation pattern with:
- HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) query rewriting for semantic search
- Intelligent reflection and result vetting with LLM-based quality review
- Conditional routing with up to 3 search iterations
- Answer generation with proper citation tracking
- Class-based architecture with dependency injection for testability
